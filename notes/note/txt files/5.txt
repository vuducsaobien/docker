What's next
    The following sections provide step-by-step guides to help you understand 
    core Docker concepts, building images, and running containers.

    - The basics
        Get started learning the core concepts of containers, images, registries, and Docker Compose.

        + What is a container?
            Learn how to run your first container.
        + What is an image?
            Learn the basics of image layers.
        + What is a registry?
            Learn about container registries, explore their interoperability, and interact with registries.
        + What is Docker Compose?
            Gain a better understanding of Docker Compose.

    - Building images
        Craft optimized container images with Dockerfiles, build cache, and multi-stage builds.

        + Understanding image layers
            Learn about the layers of container images.
        + Writing a Dockerfile
            Learn how to create an image using a Dockerfile.
        + Build, tag and publish an image
            Learn how to build, tag, and publish an image to Docker Hub or any other registry.
        + Using the build cache
            Learn about the build cache, what changes invalidate the cache, and how to effectively use the build cache.
        + Multi-stage builds
            Get a better understanding of multi-stage builds and their benefits.

    - Running containers
        Master essential techniques for exposing ports, overriding defaults, 
        persisting data, sharing files, and managing multi-container applications.
        
        + Publishing ports
            Understand the significance of publishing and exposing ports in Docker.
        + Overriding container defaults
            Learn how to override the container defaults using the `docker run` command
        + Persisting container data
            Learn the significance of data persistence in Docker.
        + Sharing local files with containers
            Explore the various storage options available in Docker and their common usage.
        + Multi-container applications
            Learn the significance of multi-container applications and how they're 
            different from single-container applications.
