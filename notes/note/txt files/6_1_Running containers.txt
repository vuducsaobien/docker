This page details how to use the `docker run` command to run containers.
- General form
    `docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]`
    The `docker run` command must specify an `image reference` to create the container from.

- Image references
    The image reference is the name and version of the image. 
    You can use the image reference to create or run a container based on an image.
        + docker run IMAGE[:TAG][@DIGEST]
        + docker create IMAGE[:TAG][@DIGEST]

Filesystem mounts
    - By default, the data in a container is stored in an ephemeral, 
    writable container layer. Removing the container also removes its data. 
    If you want to use persistent data with containers, 
    you can use filesystem mounts to store the data persistently on the host system. 
    Filesystem mounts can also let you share data between containers and the host.

    - Docker supports two main categories of mounts:
        + Volume mounts
        + Bind mounts
    - Volume mounts are great for persistently storing data for containers, 
    and for sharing data between containers. 
    Bind mounts, on the other hand, are for sharing data between a container and the host.

    - You can add a filesystem mount to a container
    using the --mount flag for the docker run command.

    - The following sections show basic examples of how to create volumes and bind mounts. 
    For more in-depth examples and descriptions, 
    refer to the section of the storage section in the documentation.

Volume mounts
    To create a volume mount:
    `docker run --mount source=<VOLUME_NAME>,target=[PATH] [IMAGE] [COMMAND...]`
        The `--mount` flag takes two parameters in this case: `source` and `target`. 
        The value for the `source` parameter is the name of the volume. 
        The value of `target` is the mount location of the volume inside the container. 
        Once you've created the volume, any data you write to the volume is persisted, 
        even if you stop or remove the container:

        docker run --rm --mount source=my_volume,target=/foo busybox \
        echo "hello, volume!" > /foo/hello.txt
        docker run --mount source=my_volume,target=/bar busybox
        cat /bar/hello.txt
        hello, volume!
