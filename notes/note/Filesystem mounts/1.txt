By default, the data in a container is stored in an ephemeral, writable container layer. 
Removing the container also removes its data. 
If you want to use persistent data with containers, 
you can use filesystem mounts to store the data persistently on the host system. 
Filesystem mounts can also let you share data between containers and the host.

Docker supports two main categories of mounts:
    - Volume mounts
    - Bind mounts

Volume mounts are great for persistently storing data for containers, 
and for sharing data between containers. 
Bind mounts, on the other hand, are for sharing data between a container and the host.

You can add a filesystem mount to a container using the `--mount` flag for the `docker run` command.

The following sections show basic examples of how to create volumes and bind mounts. 
For more in-depth examples and descriptions, 
refer to the section of the storage section in the documentation.
