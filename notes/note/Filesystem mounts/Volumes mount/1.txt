If you start a container with a volume that doesn't yet exist, 
Docker creates the volume for you. 
The following example mounts the volume myvol2 into /app/ in the container.

The following -v and --mount examples produce the same result. 
You can't run them both unless you remove the devtest container and the myvol2 volume after running the first one.

     docker run -d \
    --name devtest \
    --mount source=myvol2,target=/app \
    nginx:latest

     docker run -d \
    --name devtest \
    -v myvol2:/app \
    nginx:latest

Use a volume with Docker Compose
    The following example shows a single Docker Compose service with a volume:
        ```
            services:
                frontend:
                    image: node:lts
                    volumes:
                    - myapp:/home/node/app
                volumes:
                myapp:
        ```

Running `docker compose up` for the first time creates a volume. 
Docker reuses the same volume when you run the command subsequently.

You can create a volume directly outside of Compose 
using `docker volume create` and then reference it inside `compose.yaml` as follows:
    ```
        services:
        frontend:
            image: node:lts
            volumes:
            - myapp:/home/node/app
        volumes:
        myapp:
            external: true
    ```
