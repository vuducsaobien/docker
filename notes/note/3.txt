Xoá tất cả Container, Images, Build, Volume trên Docker Desktop:
    - docker system prune -a --volumes -f

cd getting-started-todo-app-main 
docker build -t DOCKER_USERNAME/getting-started-todo-app .
docker build -t ducvu1995/getting-started-todo-app .

3. To verify the image exists locally, you can use the docker image ls command:
    docker image ls
        REPOSITORY                           TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
        ducvu1995/getting-started-todo-app   latest    85b50079fbc1   29 seconds ago   1.75GB
        
4. To push the image, use the `docker push` command. Be sure to replace DOCKER_USERNAME with your username:
    Docker Hub có API công khai cho phép bạn xem danh sách tag (mỗi tag = 1 image version).

    curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/ducvu1995/getting-started-todo-app/tags/ | jq '.results[].name'
    (Rỗng)
    docker push ducvu1995/getting-started-todo-app
    curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/ducvu1995/getting-started-todo-app/tags/ | jq '.results[].name'
    => "latest"

5. Recap
    Before you move on, take a moment and reflect on what happened here. Within a few moments, 
    you were able to build a container image that packages your application and push it to Docker Hub.
    Going forward, you’ll want to remember that:

    Docker Hub is the go-to registry for finding trusted content. 
    Docker provides a collection of trusted content, composed of Docker Official Images, 
    Docker Verified Publishers, and Docker Sponsored Open Source Software, 
    to use directly or as bases for your own images.

    Docker Hub provides a marketplace to distribute your own applications. 
    Anyone can create an account and distribute images. 
    While you are publicly distributing the image you created, 
    private repositories can ensure your images are accessible to only authorized users.
